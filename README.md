## a treat for your taste buds

##  We are making sweet mess, in this dish we will make a cardammom and coffee ice-cream and lemon meringue to go with it and also chocolate shards for better presentation

 ## so first starting with the coffee and cardammom ice-cream we will boil the milk with cardammom for the essence to kick in, and while it boils temper some chocolate for chocolate shards

## once the chocolate is tempered we will let it cool for later use

## remove the cardammom and add coffee in the milk ,add some sugar so that the bitterness of the coffee does not over-power it,and put in the churner

## now remove the chocolate from the freezer and break it into long pieces

## let's start with the lemon meringue,take egg whites of 4 eggs and put it in the blender along with sugar and lemon zest let it blend until a soft silky texture 

## assembling take the ice-cream from the churner and scope it with a spoon giving it a shell shape take the shards aand pierce it around the ice-cream ,take the lemon meringue and put under the ice-cream giving it a floating on the clouds effect
